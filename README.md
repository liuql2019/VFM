Mine phages from metagenomes in the form of bins and contigs  
============================================================
VFM is developed for identifing phages from metagenomic bins or contigs, which is designed in two versionsï¼š bin-VFM for metagenomic bins and unbin-VFM for metagenomic contigs.  
This project is composed of predicting and training scripts.The details are as follows.
* Predicting scripts - Predict bins or contigs as phages or bacteria    
bin-VFM_predict.py    
unbin-VFM_pred.py
* Training scripts - Train a new model by user's own data  
train_bin-VFM.py  
train_unbin-VFM.py  
## Requirement and Dependency
The system must be Linux, with Python3 installed on.
